## FRONTEND
## Grunt -> Compass Project Starter

## Theme Requirements (to compile with grunt):

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) Install Node first
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) npm install -g grunt-cli
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) gem install sass
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org) gem install compass

## To ensure all the counterparts are installed, run

* sass -v
* npm -v
* compass -v
## To Compile SCSS with grunt:

1. cd into the themes' app directory, where the gruntfile.js and the package.json files are
    2. run 'npm install' to install the node_modules (including grunt and compass, as defined on the package.json in themes' app directory)
    2. run 'grunt' (default task for grunt, as defined on gruntfile.js in themes' app directory)
    3. run 'grunt dev' (task setup to run the watch task, as defined on gruntfile.js in themes' app directory)

## To Compile SCSS without npm/grunt/compass:

1. cd into the themes' app directory, where the gruntfile.js and the package.json files are
   a. inside the themes' app directory
    2. on _/scss/main.scss, comment out the @include 'compass' on main.scss
    3. run 'sass --watch _/scss/main.scss:_/css/main.css'
